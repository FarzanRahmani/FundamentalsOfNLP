Who was the first president of the United States?,"In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.","The first president of the United States was George Washington.

What is the capital city of France?,"Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.[citation needed] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes. Modern Paris owes much to its late 19th century Second Empire remodelling by the Baron Haussmann: many of modern Paris' busiest streets, avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation. Paris also owes its style to its aligned street-fronts, distinctive cream-grey ""Paris stone"" building ornamentation, aligned top-floor balconies, and tree-lined boulevards. The high residential population of its city centre makes it much different from most other western global cities.","The capital city of France is Paris. It is known as the City of Light due to its iconic Eiffel Tower and its rich cultural heritage. Paris is also home to many famous landmarks such as the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Palace of Versailles.

Who wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'?,"Drama is literature intended for performance. The form is often combined with music and dance, as in opera and musical theatre. A play is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters, and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A closet drama, by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page. Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.","William Shakespeare wrote the play ""Romeo and Juliet."" He was an English poet, actor, and playwright who lived from 1564 to 1616.

What is the main function of the human heart?,"The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.","The main function of the human heart is to pump blood throughout the body. It does this by contracting and expanding, creating pressure differences that push blood through the arteries and veins. The heart has four chambers: two atria (the upper chambers) and two ventricles (the lower chambers). The atria receive deoxygenated blood from the lungs and the ventricles pump it to the rest of the body. The heart also plays a role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining a stable internal environment. Additionally, the heart is responsible for producing hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which help regulate the body's response to stress and exercise. Overall, the heart is a vital organ that helps maintain life and health.","The human heart is a unique organ that has evolved to perform a variety of functions. It is a pump that pumps blood throughout the body, it is a muscle that is used to generate force during flight, and it is a skeletal structure that is used to","The avian heart is composed of a myogenic heart that is made up of a fibrous pericardial sac.

What is the chemical symbol for gold?,"Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient Egypt and Mycenae, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of colored gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to silver to make sterling silver, increasing its strength for use in dishes, silverware, and other practical items. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers. Around 250 BC, Archimedes was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of ""Eureka!"" upon the discovery of Archimedes' principle.","The chemical symbol for gold is Au. It stands for the Latin word ""aurum,"" which translates to ""gold."" This symbol is widely recognized and helps chemists identify gold compounds and their properties. Gold is an element that has been extensively studied due to its unique properties and uses in various industries. Its symbol serves as a reminder of its importance in the world of chemistry and materials science.","The concept of a universal language for communication between people has been a subject of speculation and debate for centuries.

What is the longest river in the world?,"Galicia is poetically known as the ""country of the thousand rivers"" (""o país dos mil ríos""). The largest and most important of these rivers is the Minho, known as O Pai Miño (Father Minho), 307.5 km (191.1 mi) long and discharging 419 m3 (548 cu yd) per second, with its affluent the Sil, which has created a spectacular canyon. Most of the rivers in the inland are tributaries of this fluvial system, which drains some 17,027 km2 (6,574 sq mi). Other rivers run directly into the Atlantic Ocean as Lérez or the Cantabrian Sea, most of them having short courses. Only the Navia, Ulla, Tambre, and Limia have courses longer than 100 km (62 mi).","The longest river in the world is the Amazon River, which is approximately 4,000 kilometers (2,490 miles) long. It flows through nine countries in South America and is one of the most important waterways in the world. However, it's worth noting that there are many other rivers around the world that are just as long or even longer, so it really depends on what you're looking for!

Who painted the Mona Lisa?,"The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.","The Mona Lisa is painted by Leonardo da Vinci.

What is the speed of light?,"Albert Einstein proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the principle of relativity. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by Maxwell's equations, which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the luminiferous ether. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.","The speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second or 186,282 miles per second. This constant is also known as the speed of light in a vacuum and is considered to be one of the fundamental constants of nature. It is an important concept in many areas of science, including electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. The speed of light is a universal constant, meaning that it is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the source of the light. This constant has been measured with great precision over time and is widely accepted as a fundamental property of the universe. It is often used as a benchmark for measuring other speeds, such as the speed of sound or the speed of electrons in matter. Additionally, the speed of light plays a crucial role in the development of modern technology, such as telecommunications, lasers, and satellite communication systems. Overall, the speed of light is a fundamental aspect of our understanding of the universe and its properties.",The discovery of exoplanets outside our solar system has renewed interest in the nature of planets in the universe.

What is the capital of Japan?,"When Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Heian-kyō (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years, he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically. Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of Dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there. Kyōto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces. The early Heian period (784–967) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese Tang capital at Chang'an, as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu endeavoured to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use. Known as the ritsuryō, this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan, despite the ""tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries"". Despite the decline of the Taika-Taihō reforms, imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Indeed, Kammu's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan's most forceful emperors.","The capital of Japan is Tokyo. It has been the capital since 1868. However, before that, it was Kyoto from 794 until 1868. The city is located in the Kantō region of Japan. It is known for its many temples and shrines, including the famous Golden Pavilion and the Fushimi Inari Shrine. The city is also home to several important historical sites, such as the Meiji Shrine and the Imperial Palace. Additionally, Tokyo is a major economic center and a hub for technology and innovation. It is also a popular tourist destination, with attractions like the Shibuya Crossing and the Tokyo Skytree.

Who discovered penicillin?,"The effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history (see: History of penicillin). In 1928, Alexander Fleming noticed the same effect in a Petri dish, where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus Penicillium. Fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named penicillin, and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.","Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin. He observed the effect of a fungus called Penicillium on a petri dish containing bacteria, which led him to hypothesize about an antibacterial compound and eventually develop penicillin as a chemical treatment for bacterial infections. This discovery revolutionized medicine and has saved countless lives.","The use of penicillin in medicine is to treat infections caused by bacteria. Penicillin is used to treat a wide range of infections caused by bacteria, including infections of the skin, mouth, throat, eyes, nose, and urinary tract.
