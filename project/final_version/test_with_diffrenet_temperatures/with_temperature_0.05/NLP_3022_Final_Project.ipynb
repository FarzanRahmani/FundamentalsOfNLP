If you utilize any of these tools, make sure to attach the chat history that led you to the answer to your question, or the code, to this .ipynb document. (You must provide the entire chat, not just the final answer or your initial prompt.) 💻\n",

        "## What is RAG? 🤔\n",
        "We've all used ChatGPT and experienced moments when it starts to generate content that is often incorrect or unrelated to our query. Do you know why this happens? These Large Language Models (LLMs) are not magical entities; they are simply models trained on a vast amount of text. 📚 You could even consider a significant portion of the internet. However, this is not all the data available in the world, because data is not a static concept. You yourself generate some data every day through your use of the Internet, Social Media, and so on. 🌐💻📱\n",
        "\n",
        "So, no matter how much data you use to train your LLM, you always end up encountering new data. This is one of the reasons behind the famous ChatGPT response that tells you it only knows things up to a certain date. 📅 Also, these models tend to hallucinate too. It means they provide incorrect answers but in a very convincing manner. 🎭\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, we have retrieval techniques. Don't worry if it sounds complicated (it actually isn't easy, you may need to take a course to familiarize yourself with these concepts 😅, but that's not necessary for this project), but you use it on a daily basis. You can think of Search Engines (like Google, for example) as a complex form of information retrieval. 🔍\n",
        "\n",
        "So, one day, people came up with this idea that it would be cool if ChatGPT could search Google for us, read the articles for us, summarize what it read, and tell us that. 📖 So, this is not exactly what RAG is, but it's something similar. We have a corpus (a large amount of data) and a query (what a user typed as input). Now, we search through this corpus using techniques related to vectors and vector databases, and find the most similar items in our corpus to the query. Then, we pass these items to an LLM and ask for a structured, well-formatted, user-friendly output. 📈📊"

Initially, I wanted to use this article as the basis for this project, but unfortunately, the llama_index library used in the article seems to be outdated, so most of the code would need to be rewritten. On second thought, I found it more useful to focus on core concepts rather than learning specific libraries. You might want to check out some libraries like langchain or llama_index which provide a lot of tools for RAG. (But not for this project) 📝💡\n",
        "- Don't hesitate to use Google, ask chatbots about any new concepts and terms. If you use search engine-aware chatbots like Microsoft Copilot, they provide links for each part of their answers which is useful if you want to delve deeper into that part. 🌐🤖\n",

        "To create your retriever, you need to use an encoder model. Something like BERT? Nah, BERT is so yesterday. Find something new and shiny! ✨ The basic idea is to encode every document (sentence) in your corpus into a vector space using the same encoder. Then, encode the user query into that same space. With some similarity metrics like dot product, you can find the most similar document to the user’s input and retrieve it. 🎯 You can train your own encoder if you have enough data and resources, 💪 or you can use one of those [ready-made on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=trending), like these ones."

This site has historical significance and is now known as the National Mall in Washington D.C. It's important to note that the Constitution of the United States was not ratified until 1788, so it wasn't yet in effect when Washington took office.

It is located on the border between Nepal and China. This mountain is part of the Himalayas, one of the world's most prominent mountain ranges. The Himalayas span across several countries, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The region also includes other notable peaks such as K2, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu, all of which are over 8,000 meters high. The Himalayas are known for their rugged terrain, steep slopes, and diverse wildlife, attracting climbers from around the world who seek to conquer these towering peaks. Despite its height, Mount Everest remains accessible to many people due to its relatively low altitude compared to other peaks in the region. However, it is important to note that climbing Mount Everest is a dangerous endeavor and requires specialized training and equipment. Climbers must also adhere to strict safety protocols to ensure their well-being during the ascent and descent phases of the climb. Additionally, the environmental impact of tourism in the region, particularly in areas like Everest Base Camp, should be considered when discussing the importance of preserving this natural wonder.\",\n          \"The first woman to win a Nobel Prize is Marie Curie.
