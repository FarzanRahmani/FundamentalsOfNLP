Who was the first president of the United States?,"In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street. By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.","The first president of the United States was George Washington. He was inaugurated in 1789 and served two terms from 1789-1797. He is often considered one of the greatest presidents in American history. The first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States also convened at Federal Hall in New York City. This site has historical significance and is now known as the National Mall in Washington D.C. It's important to note that the Constitution of the United States was not written until 1787, so it wasn't until then that the first capital of the United States was established. However, Federal Hall was the first official seat of government for the new nation.","The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world.

What is the capital city of France?,"Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that, contrary to many other of the world's capitals, has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map.[citation needed] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes. Modern Paris owes much to its late 19th century Second Empire remodelling by the Baron Haussmann: many of modern Paris' busiest streets, avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation. Paris also owes its style to its aligned street-fronts, distinctive cream-grey ""Paris stone"" building ornamentation, aligned top-floor balconies, and tree-lined boulevards. The high residential population of its city centre makes it much different from most other western global cities.","The capital city of France is Paris. It is known as the City of Love due to its romantic atmosphere and rich culture. Paris is also famous for its iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum. Additionally, Paris is home to many historical sites and museums, including the Palace of Versailles and the Musée d'Orsay.

What is the largest planet in our solar system?,"Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Among the giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[c] Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50×109 km). Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.","The largest planet in our solar system is Neptune. It has a diameter of about 24,900 kilometers and is much larger than other planets like Jupiter or Saturn. It also has a very strong gravitational pull that can cause objects to orbit around it instead of just circling around the sun. This makes Neptune one of the most interesting and mysterious planets in our solar system. Is there anything else you would like to know about Neptune?","Neptune is a gas giant in the Solar System.

Who wrote the play 'Romeo and Juliet'?,"Drama is literature intended for performance. The form is often combined with music and dance, as in opera and musical theatre. A play is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters, and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A closet drama, by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page. Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.","William Shakespeare wrote the play ""Romeo and Juliet."" He was an English poet, actor, and playwright who lived from 1564 to 1616. His works include many plays, sonnets, and other poems that have become part of the English language's cultural heritage.

What is the main function of the human heart?,"The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.","The main function of the human heart is to pump blood throughout the body. It does this by contracting and expanding, creating pressure differences that force blood through the arteries and veins. The heart has four chambers - two atria (the upper chambers) and two ventricles (the lower chambers). The atria receive deoxygenated blood from the lungs and the ventricles pump it to the rest of the body. The heart also plays a role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining a stable internal environment. Additionally, the heart is responsible for producing hormones such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which help regulate the body's response to stress and exercise. Overall, the heart is a vital organ that helps maintain life and health.",The heart is a complex organ that is highly adapted to flight.

What is the chemical symbol for gold?,"Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient Egypt and Mycenae, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of colored gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to silver to make sterling silver, increasing its strength for use in dishes, silverware, and other practical items. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers. Around 250 BC, Archimedes was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of ""Eureka!"" upon the discovery of Archimedes' principle.","The chemical symbol for gold is Au. It stands for the Latin word ""aurum,"" which translates to ""gold."" This symbol is widely recognized and helps chemists identify gold compounds and elements. Gold is an element that has been extensively studied due to its unique properties and uses in various industries. Its chemical symbol reflects its position on the periodic table, where it is located at the 73rd position. Additionally, this symbol aids in understanding the structure and behavior of gold compounds, making it essential for researchers and scientists working in the field of chemistry.","The ancient Chinese used gold in a variety of applications, including jewelry, coins, and other items. They also used it in the production of jewelry, coins, and other items, such as in the manufacture of amulets and talismans.

What is the longest river in the world?,"Galicia is poetically known as the ""country of the thousand rivers"" (""o país dos mil ríos""). The largest and most important of these rivers is the Minho, known as O Pai Miño (Father Minho), 307.5 km (191.1 mi) long and discharging 419 m3 (548 cu yd) per second, with its affluent the Sil, which has created a spectacular canyon. Most of the rivers in the inland are tributaries of this fluvial system, which drains some 17,027 km2 (6,574 sq mi). Other rivers run directly into the Atlantic Ocean as Lérez or the Cantabrian Sea, most of them having short courses. Only the Navia, Ulla, Tambre, and Limia have courses longer than 100 km (62 mi).","The longest river in the world is the Amazon River, which is approximately 4,000 kilometers (2,490 miles) long. It flows through nine countries in South America and empties into the Pacific Ocean. However, it's worth noting that the length of a river can vary depending on how it's measured and where it starts and ends. For example, the Nile River in Africa is often considered the longest river by traditional measures, but it actually has a shorter total length due to its complex course and numerous tributaries. So while the Amazon River is indeed the longest river in terms of distance from its source to the ocean, there are other rivers that could potentially be considered the longest if you were to measure their lengths differently.
 
In summary, the Amazon River is the longest river in the world by traditional measures, but there are other rivers that could potentially be considered the longest if you were to measure their lengths differently. Additionally, the length of a river can vary depending on how it's measured and where it starts and ends. Therefore, it's difficult to say definitively what the longest river in the world is without more information about the specific criteria being used for measurement.","The 2019–2020 AFL season was the 122nd season of the Australian rules football competition, the AFL.

Who painted the Mona Lisa?,"The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Gavarni, and Alphonse Mucha.","The Mona Lisa is painted by Leonardo da Vinci. He was an Italian polymath who lived from 1452-1519. He is known for his contributions to fields like painting, sculpture, architecture, engineering, mathematics, science, music, literature, and philosophy. His most famous work is the Mona Lisa, which is one of the most recognizable paintings in the world. It depicts a woman with a mysterious smile that has captivated viewers for centuries. Da Vinci's other notable works include the Last Supper, the Vitruvian Man, and the Mona Lisa herself. He was born in Italy but spent much of his life working in France. He died there at the age of 56 years old. He left behind a legacy of incredible artistic talent and creativity. He is considered one of the greatest artists of all time.","The Mona Lisa is a painting by the French artist Leonardo da Vinci. It is one of the most famous paintings in the world, and is considered one of the most famous works of art in the world. The painting is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.

What is the speed of light?,"Albert Einstein proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the principle of relativity. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by Maxwell's equations, which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the luminiferous ether. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.","The speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second or 186,282 miles per second. It is considered to be one of the fundamental constants of nature and is an important part of many physical phenomena, including the behavior of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The speed of light is also a key component of the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Additionally, the speed of light has been used as a standard unit of measurement in various fields such as astronomy and quantum mechanics.",The Doppler effect is a phenomenon observed when light,The speed of light is relative to the luminiferous ether.

What is the capital of Japan?,"When Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Heian-kyō (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years, he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically. Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of Dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there. Kyōto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces. The early Heian period (784–967) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese Tang capital at Chang'an, as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu endeavoured to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use. Known as the ritsuryō, this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan, despite the ""tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries"". Despite the decline of the Taika-Taihō reforms, imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Indeed, Kammu's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan's most forceful emperors.","The capital of Japan is Tokyo. It is located in the Kantō region and is the largest city in Japan. However, historically, the capital has been shifted several times throughout Japanese history, including to Kyoto, Osaka, and later to Tokyo. The current capital of Japan is Tokyo.","The capital of Japan has been Osaka since 1868.
 Context: The capital of Japan was moved to Osaka in 1868 following the death of Emperor Meiji. The capital shifted from Nara, which was located on the Chinese border, to Osaka because of the superior geopolitical position of Osaka. The capital shift was a response to the decline of the Taika-Taihō reforms, which were implemented by Emperor Meiji in the 1860s. The Taika-Taihō reforms were a series of reforms introduced by Emperor Meiji in the 1860s to improve the Imperial government. They aimed to recreate the Tang imperial system, which had been in place in Japan at the time, but they were not implemented. The Taika-Taihō reforms were a response to the increasing power of the Buddhist institutions and were not implemented. The Taika-Taihō reforms were not implemented again until the 19th century.

Who discovered penicillin?,"The effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history (see: History of penicillin). In 1928, Alexander Fleming noticed the same effect in a Petri dish, where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus Penicillium. Fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named penicillin, and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.","Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin. He observed the effect of a fungus on a Petri dish containing bacteria, which led him to hypothesize about an antibacterial compound. He then characterized some of its biological properties and attempted to use it as a treatment for infections, though his efforts were unsuccessful due to lack of training in chemistry. His discovery laid the foundation for modern antibiotic therapy.","The discovery of penicillin was made by Alexander Fleming, a British chemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 for his work on the development of the antibiotic penicillin. Fleming was working at the University of Sussex when he noticed the antibacterial effects of a fungus called Penicillium notatum on some of his laboratory mold experiments.

What is the largest ocean on Earth?,"Positioned asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, or by the southern waters of the World Ocean. It covers more than 14,000,000 km2 (5,400,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures 17,968 km (11,165 mi) and is mostly characterized by ice formations, as the following table shows:","The largest ocean on Earth is the Pacific Ocean. It covers approximately 63.6 million square kilometers (24.2 million square miles). The Pacific Ocean is located between Asia, Australia, and the Americas, and it extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Antarctic Peninsula in the south. It is also the second-largest body of water in terms of volume after the Sea of Okhotsk.
 
The other major oceans on Earth include the Atlantic Ocean, which covers approximately 24.4 million square kilometers (9.4 million square miles), and the Indian Ocean, which covers approximately 23.5 million square kilometers (9.0 million square miles). These three oceans together form the world's oceans, which are essential for marine life and global climate patterns.","The Antarctic Treaty System is a part of the Antarctic Treaty Consolidated (ATC). It is a treaty signed by 145 countries, the Antarctic Treaty Office (ATO), and the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty establishes a system of rules and obligations for the conservation and management of Antarctic resources.

What is the largest mammal on Earth?,"Mammals include the largest animals on the planet, the rorquals and other large whales, as well as some of the most intelligent, such as elephants, primates, including humans, and cetaceans. The basic body type is a four-legged land-borne animal, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, or on two legs. The largest group of mammals, the placentals, have a placenta, which enables feeding the fetus during gestation. Mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter (108 ft) blue whale.","The largest mammal on Earth is the blue whale. It can grow up to 33 meters (108 feet) long and weigh over 200 tons. Blue whales are part of the toothed whale family and are known for their massive size and powerful jaws. They feed on krill and squid, using their long, flexible tongues to capture prey. Despite their impressive size, blue whales are not typically aggressive towards humans and are often seen swimming alongside boats.
